## About Toolkit
The Toolkit javascript framework allows you to define your HTML in a JSON structure. The structure can contain the normal html attributes, javascript events, or any custom properties and events. The framework also includes support for inheritance. When initializing, the JSON structure is processed and HTML elements are generated.

The name Toolkit is choosen because the ability to use inheritance opens up abilities to easily define, use, reuse and extend components. Toolkit comes with several built in components (Sortable Tables, Tree, Forms and more). Reusability and Structure are the main focus points for Toolkit.
